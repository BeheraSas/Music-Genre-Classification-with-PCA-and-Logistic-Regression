This initiative, Music Genre Classification utilizing PCA, seeks to examine and categorize music pieces according to different audio and musical characteristics. This project utilizes a dataset of 1000 tracks across various genres to explore the connections between musical characteristics and to effectively classify tracks into their respective genres. 

The first steps entail a comprehensive examination of the data, analyzing the features of each track and resolving any missing or inconsistent information. Utilizing correlation analysis and visualization methods, the project explores how various musical features affect genre classification, laying the groundwork for developing a dependable predictive model. The project also utilizes methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to minimize dimensionality, thus improving model performance and clarity. 

The primary objective is to create a classification model that can autonomously allocate genres to untagged tracks, allowing for efficient and precise genre identification for music streaming, recommendation services, or digital music collections. This initiative provides a basis in data preprocessing, feature evaluation, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning classification, specifically adapted to the distinctive traits of audio data in the music sector.
